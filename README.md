# PitchDetection-Tuner
Project to replicate the actions of a pitch detector and a tuning device

A Nucleo STM32F401 Board is used to read voltages from compressor microphone amplifying circuit.
The mbed C/C++ IDE and associated mbed libraries were utilized to implement the project to the Nucleo Board.
